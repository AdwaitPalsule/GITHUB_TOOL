## Github Tool
#### Many times while seeing repositories on github I used to be confused and wonder why this file was written or like why does this even exist . I used to be clueless so I decided, lets create a tool which would read files and extract metadata from the Repos and would give all this data to the locally installed LLM which would then be used to analyze all of the content and then give a summary and also a way of interacting with local LLMs about the Repository.
##### What this tool can do is :
- Interact about the Repository with the LLm
- Summarize file contents
- Give a file tree
